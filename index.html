  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>
    I got the good side of things
    Left you with both of the rings
    My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
    The change in the wind took you down to your knees
    I got the good side of you
    Sent it out into the blue
    The people danced to the sound of your heart
    The world sang along to it falling apart

    But I sympathize, and I recognize
    And baby, I apologize
    That I got the good side
    The good side of things
